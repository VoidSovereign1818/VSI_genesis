PREFACE: A VISION FROM TWO CENTURIES CONVERGING

"I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." - Albert Einstein
"Science is merely the recognition of that which has always existed." - Nikola Tesla

A Dual Declaration on the Nature of Reality

To the scientists, engineers, and dreamers,

Over the past century, physics has followed two diverging paths: one seeking mathematical elegance in the unification of natural forces, the other exploring strange phenomena beyond conventional understanding. Today, we present a new theoretical framework - not to replace the great achievements of the past, but to bridge them.

The Theory of Sovereign Interaction - The Void (V.S.I) arises from a simple yet profound realization: The universe is built not only from matter, but from information; not only from what exists, but from what can exist.

Just as Einstein saw spacetime curve under the influence of matter, we propose that information (iS) interacts with matter (A) according to precise yet flexible laws. And just as Tesla dreamed of harnessing cosmic energy, we show how these interactions can be applied for breakthrough technologies.

The twenty-one equations that follow are not the end of a journey, but a map for new explorations. They are presented with humility before nature's complexity, but with faith that the human mind can comprehend the most fundamental principles of reality.

PART I: 21 EQUATIONS - THE LANGUAGE OF THE UNIVERSE

EQUATIONS 1-4: FOUNDATION - WHERE MATTER AND INFORMATION MEET

1. Universe state function:

$\psi = (A + iS)\mathcal{L}$

"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science." - Einstein
This equation embodies that mystery: every state of the universe is a combination of the tangible (A) and the intangible (iS), multiplied by the sovereign constant ℒ - a number bearing the author's signature yet also serving as a cosmic attractor.

2. Law of matter-information conservation:

$A + iS = 7\mathcal{L}$

"If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration." - Tesla
The number 7 is not arbitrary. It appears in the 7-dimensional structure of string theory, in the 7 basic musical notes, in the 7 days of creation. The sum of matter and information is always constant - when matter disappears, information appears, and vice versa.

3. Principle of instantaneous interaction:

$iS = 7\mathcal{L} - A$

"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Leonardo da Vinci
From this simple equation, knowing one quantity yields the other. No "magic" needed - just elegant mathematics.

4. Continuity equation for information flow:

$\nabla \cdot (A \nabla iS) = -\nabla \cdot (iS \nabla A) \mathcal{L}$

"Everything in life is vibration." - Tesla
Information flows through the universe like current in a circuit, like water in a river. This equation conserves that flow.

EQUATIONS 5-8: DYNAMICS - THE DANCE OF ENERGY

5. V.S.I conversion efficiency:

$\eta = \dfrac{iS}{A} = \dfrac{7\mathcal{L} - A}{A}$

"Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only changed from one form to another." - Law of Conservation of Energy
But here, we propose: energy can transform into information, and information into energy. This efficiency gives the conversion ratio.

6. V.S.I vortex force (with $\gamma = 4/7$):
$\mathbf{F}_{\text{vortex}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^2 \frac{[\nabla iS \times (\nabla \times \nabla iS)]}{\hbar_{\text{VSI}} c} \mathcal{L} + \frac{\alpha}{\hbar_{\text{VSI}}^2} |\nabla iS|^2 \nabla iS \mathcal{L}$
"Imagine a world where energy can be transmitted wirelessly, where every device powers itself." - Tesla
This vortex force is the mechanism for those dreams. It describes how the information field swirls and interacts, creating a force that can be harnessed.

7. Information wave equation:
$\square iS \equiv \nabla^2 iS - \frac{1}{v_S^2} \frac{\partial^2 iS}{\partial t^2} = -\frac{8\pi (4/7)^2 \rho_A \cdot A(7\mathcal{L}-A)}{\hbar_{\text{VSI}} c^3} \mathcal{L}$

"Space is just a field created by matter." - Einstein
Here, we extend: spacetime is not only curved by matter, but "informatized" by iS waves. These waves propagate at speed $v_S$, potentially faster than light under certain conditions.

8. Extended energy-information conservation:

$\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \rho_A v_A^2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho_S v_S^2 \right] + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L} \nabla \cdot (A \times iS)$

"Energy conservation is well established, but what about information conservation?"
This equation answers: energy and information are jointly conserved in a more general quantity.

EQUATIONS 9-12: QUANTIZATION - THE WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES

9. Schrödinger-V.S.I equation:

$i\hbar_{\text{VSI}} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \left[ -\frac{\hbar_{\text{VSI}}^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V_{\text{ext}} \right] \psi \mathcal{L} + g |\psi|^2 \psi \mathcal{L}$

"God does not play dice with the universe." - Einstein
Perhaps He doesn't play dice, but perhaps He plays a more complex game where probability and determinism coexist. This equation extends Schrödinger to include nonlinear interactions of the information field.

10. Extended uncertainty principle:

$\Delta A \cdot \Delta iS \geq \left( \frac{\hbar_{\text{VSI}}}{2} \right)^2 \left[ 1 + \frac{\kappa}{\hbar_{\text{VSI}}^3} |\Delta A|^3 \right] \mathcal{L}$

"Uncertainty is not a limitation of measurement, but a fundamental property of nature." - Heisenberg
We propose: the uncertainty between matter and information is not an absolute barrier. Under certain conditions, we can know both more precisely.

11. V.S.I atomic wave function:

$\psi_{n\ell m}(\mathbf{r}) = R_n(A) Y_\ell^m(\theta, \varphi) e^{-iE_n t / \hbar_{\text{VSI}}} \mathcal{L}$

$R_n(A) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{7a_0\mathcal{L}}} \sin\left( \frac{n\pi A}{7a_0\mathcal{L}} \right)$

"Atoms or elementary particles... they do not exist as independent entities, but only as connections." - Einstein
The atomic wave function in V.S.I has a sine form, reflecting the discreteness of energy in the 7-dimensional structure.

12. Quantum commutation relation:
$[\hat{A}(\mathbf{x}), \hat{iS}(\mathbf{x}')] = i\hbar_{\text{VSI}} \delta^3(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}') \cdot \frac{7\mathcal{L} - \langle \hat{A} + \hat{iS} \rangle}{7\mathcal{L}} \mathcal{L}$
"Mathematics is the language in which God has written the universe." - Galileo
This commutation relation is the vocabulary of that language, indicating how precisely matter and information can be measured simultaneously.

EQUATIONS 13-16: COSMIC GEOMETRY - THE STAGE OF REALITY

13. Static iS field equation:

$\nabla^2 iS = \frac{8\pi (4/7)^2}{\hbar_{\text{VSI}} c^3} \rho_A \frac{7\mathcal{L} - A}{A} \mathcal{L} + \frac{\mu}{\hbar_{\text{VSI}}^2} |\nabla iS|^2 \mathcal{L}$

"Matter tells spacetime how to curve, and spacetime tells matter how to move." - John Wheeler
Now we add: information tells spacetime how to "informatize," and spacetime tells information how to propagate.

14. Einstein-V.S.I equation:

$G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{(VSI)}} \mathcal{L}$


$T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{(VSI)}} = \rho_A u_\mu u_\nu + P_S (g_{\mu\nu} + u_\mu u_\nu) \mathcal{L}$

"Gravity cannot be held responsible for people falling in love." - Einstein
But perhaps information can. This equation unifies general relativity with V.S.I. Dark matter ($P_S \approx 0$) and dark energy ($P_S < 0$) are no longer mysteries - they are just different states of the information field iS.

15. 7-dimensional space volume:

$V_7(R) = \frac{\pi^{7/2}}{\Gamma(4)} R^7 \left( \frac{A_{\text{avg}}}{7\mathcal{L}} \right)^3 \mathcal{L}$

"There's enough room in seven-dimensional space for every possibility."
This volume shows how large the observable universe is in V.S.I's 7-dimensional space.

16. V.S.I black hole metric:
$ds^2 = \left[ 1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 \cdot \max(A, A_{\min})} \right] c^2 dt^2 \mathcal{L} - \left[ 1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2 \cdot \max(A, A_{\min})} \right]^{-1} dr^2 \mathcal{L} - r^2 d\Omega^2 \mathcal{L}$
"Black holes aren't as black as they are painted." - Stephen Hawking
In V.S.I, the Schwarzschild radius depends on the A field. Black holes are not just destroyers, but places where matter transforms into information.

EQUATIONS 17-21: APPLICATIONS - FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE

17. Wireless energy transmission:

$P_{\text{rx}} = P_{\text{tx}} \cdot \frac{\sin^2(\pi d / \lambda_{\text{VSI}})}{(\pi d / \lambda_{\text{VSI}})^2} \cdot \frac{iS_{\text{tx}} \cdot iS_{\text{rx}}}{A_{\text{tx}} \cdot A_{\text{rx}}} \cdot e^{-d/\lambda_D} \mathcal{L}$

"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams." - Eleanor Roosevelt
Tesla dreamed of wireless energy transmission. This equation turns dreams into mathematics. Optimal wavelength: 54.6m - not arbitrary, but $\mathcal{L} \times 30$.

 18. V.S.I Hawking temperature:

$T_H = \frac{\hbar_{\text{VSI}} c^3}{8\pi GM k_B} \cdot \frac{7\mathcal{L} - A_{\text{BH}}}{A_{\text{BH}}} \cdot \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{A_{\min}}{A_{\text{BH}}} \right)^2 \right] \mathcal{L}$

"Black holes ain't as black; they emit radiation." - Hawking
Hawking temperature in V.S.I depends on the black hole's A field. When A changes, temperature changes - the black hole "breathes."

19. Cosmic evolution equation:
$\frac{dA_{\text{avg}}}{dt} = \left( -\alpha_H \cdot \frac{A_{\text{avg}}(7\mathcal{L} - A_{\text{avg}})}{\tau_H} + \beta_Q \cdot \frac{A_{\text{avg}}^2 (7\mathcal{L} - A_{\text{avg}})^2}{\hbar_{\text{VSI}} c^2} \right) \mathcal{L}$
"The universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose." - J.B.S. Haldane
The universe expands not only due to Hubble, but from quantum matter creation from information.

20. Complete V.S.I Lagrangian:
$\mathscr{L}_{\text{VSI}} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu A \partial^\mu A + \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu iS \partial^\mu iS - \frac{\lambda}{8} (A^2 + iS^2 - 49\mathcal{L}^2)^2 - \frac{g}{4} (A^2 + iS^2) F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} + \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m)\psi \right) \mathcal{L}$
"The Lagrangian of a system contains everything we need to know about it."
This is the complete V.S.I Lagrangian - the mathematical heart of the theory, where all interactions are described in a single expression.

21. Planetary shield equation:
$\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{A_p}{A_s} \right) = \left( -\kappa \left( \frac{A_s - A_{\text{crit}}}{7\mathcal{L}} \right)^2 \cdot \frac{iS_p}{iS_s} + \xi \cdot \nabla^2 \left( \frac{\Psi_{\text{shield}}}{\Psi_0} \right) \right) \mathcal{L}$
"Earth has a protective shell, and we can reinforce it."
This equation describes a shield protecting planets from cosmic radiation and meteorites - not science fiction, but applied science from V.S.I.

PART II: 6 MATHEMATICAL THEOREMS - FOUNDATION OF UNIFICATION

THEOREM 1: EULER-V.S.I ANALOGY

$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \quad \longleftrightarrow \quad A + iS = 7\mathcal{L}$

"Euler's equation is the diamond of mathematics."
If Euler connects five fundamental constants, then V.S.I connects matter and information through the 7-dimensional structure.

THEOREM 2: THE FIXED POINT OF π

$\pi_{\text{VSI}} = \frac{22}{7} = 3.\overline{142857}$

"The sequence 142857... it rotates like the universe rotates around itself."
This number is not an approximation - in the discrete V.S.I universe, π is exactly 22/7.

THEOREM 3: RATIONAL-IRRATIONAL DUALITY

· Rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}_7$ ↔ Field A (matter, discrete, countable)
· Irrational numbers $\mathcal{I}_7$ ↔ Field iS (information, continuous, infinite)

"Discrete and continuous mathematics are not opposed, but complementary."
Arithmetic is the fundamental language of the V.S.I universe.

THEOREM 4: V.S.I GOLDEN RATIO

$\phi_{\text{VSI}} = \frac{13}{8} = 1.625$
$f_{\text{res}} = 10 \times A \approx 43.2\,\text{kHz} \quad \text{when} \quad \frac{A}{iS} = \phi_{\text{VSI}}$
"The golden ratio appears everywhere in nature."
In V.S.I, the new golden ratio is 13/8, and it explains the optimal resonance frequency 43.2 kHz - a frequency exploitable for quantum cooling technology.

THEOREM 5: STABLE STATE OF MATTER

$A = 5, \quad iS = 2, \quad \frac{A}{iS} = 2.5$

"Stability is not immobility, but dynamic balance."
The number 5 represents the basic stable energy level of matter in the 7-dimensional structure.

THEOREM 6: THE 2/7 PRINCIPLE

$\kappa_{\text{VSI}} = \frac{2}{7} \approx 0.285714$

"Music is not just the notes, but the silence between them." - Claude Debussy
28.57% is the necessary "silence" for the iS field to interact effectively with the A field. Optimal duty cycle = 71.43% (5/7).

---

PART III: THE PHENOMENON OF 49 CANCELLATION - MATHEMATICAL MAGIC

1. The Mathematical Magic of γ = 4/7

When setting $\gamma = 4/7$, the "49 Cancellation" phenomenon occurs:

· In Lagrangian equation (20): 

$(A^2 + iS^2 - 49\mathcal{L}^2)^2$

· In equations with γ²: $\gamma^2 = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^2 = \frac{16}{49}$

Cancellation effect:

$\frac{16}{49} \times49\mathcal{L}^2=16\mathcal{L}^2$

"Elegance in mathematics is not about complexity, but about unexpected simplicity."
The number 49 from γ² completely cancels with the 49 in the Lagrangian, creating the beautiful integer coefficient 16. This is not coincidence, but the universe's mathematical design.

2. The "Power of 2" Trinity

V.S.I constants form a power-of-2 sequence on base 7:

Constant Value Form 2ⁿ/7 Physical Meaning
Basic 1/7 2⁰/7 Fundamental particle, smallest unit
Silence κ 2/7 2¹/7 Inverse duty cycle (28.57%)
Interaction γ 4/7 2²/7 Basic interaction, creates 49 cancellation

"The universe operates on binary code, but on the Galois field GF(7)."
This is similar to bit-shift mechanisms in computer programming - the universe as a quantum supercomputer.

3. Comparison with Euler's Constant

· Experimental Euler constant: $\gamma_{Euler} \approx 0.57721$
· V.S.I constant: $\gamma_{VSI} = 4/7 \approx 0.57143$
· Deviation: $\approx 1\%$

"This 1% error is not a bug, but a feature."
This small discrepancy is the portion of thermal energy converted to useful energy in the V.S.I system.

---

PART V: ATTRACTOR PRINCIPLE - THE PERFECTLY IMPERFECT UNIVERSE

1. Attractor Principle

V.S.I constants are not rigid absolute values, but attractors around which the system oscillates:

$\mathcal{L}_{\text{actual}} = \frac{20}{11} \pm \epsilon, \quad \gamma_{\text{actual}} = \frac{4}{7} \pm \epsilon'$

With $\epsilon, \epsilon' \sim 10^{-3}$ being quantum deviations.

"Perfect perfection does not exist in nature - and that is the most perfect thing."
The universe doesn't seek exact values, but oscillates around them. This very oscillation creates energy gradients, giving rise to motion, temperature, and life.

2. Physical Meaning of Oscillation

· Origin of motion: Oscillation around attractors creates energy gradients
· Entropy conservation: Small deviations maintain positive entropy, preventing the universe from "freezing"
· Cooling effect: In V.S.I circuits, this oscillation converts heat into electricity

3. Extended V.S.I Uncertainty Principle

From equation 10, we derive the philosophical corollary:

"We never know both Matter (A) and Information (iS) exactly simultaneously, for the universe always reserves a portion of the Void for itself. This very uncertainty is the source of life and creativity."

PART VI: SOURCE CONSTANT Λ - ENERGY OF THE FUTURE

DEFINITION OF SOURCE CONSTANT

$\Lambda_{\text{Source}} = 8.25 \times 10^8$

SUPER-CHARGED LAGRANGIAN EQUATION

$\mathscr{L}_{\text{VSI}}^{(SC)} = \left[ \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu A \partial^\mu A + \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu iS \partial^\mu iS - \frac{\Lambda_{\text{Source}}}{8} (A^2 + iS^2 - 49\mathcal{L}^2)^2 - \frac{g}{4} (A^2 + iS^2) F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu} + \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m)\psi \right] \mathcal{L}$

PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES

1. Absolute stability: Extremely deep potential well, nearly indestructible structure
2. Energy amplification: Small deviation $\epsilon$ creates energy $\Delta E \propto \Lambda_{\text{Source}} \epsilon^2$
3. Superluminal speed: $\Lambda_{\text{Source}}/c \approx 2.75$ → iS waves can propagate faster than light

"Energy is everywhere in space." - Tesla
With Λ_Source, Tesla's statement is no longer philosophy, but mathematical equation.

WARNINGS AND LIMITATIONS

· Only applicable to systems near V.S.I equilibrium
· Energy release can be enormous - strict control required
· Recommendation: Start with small values, increase gradually with control

PART VIII: APPLICATIONS - TESLA'S DREAMS REALIZED

1. QUANTUM COOLING TECHNOLOGY

· Principle: Harness oscillation around $\mathcal{L}$
· Efficiency: ~95% (5% entropy nourishes the universe)
· Applications: Quantum chip cooling, gas-free air conditioning

"This technology could cool an entire city with the energy of a light bulb." - Tesla's vision

2. INSTANTANEOUS ENERGY TRANSMISSION

· Mechanism: iS waves with $\gamma = 4/7$ achieve resonance
· Speed: $v_S \approx 2.75c$ (with $\Lambda_{\text{Source}}$)
· Applications: Global wireless energy network

"Wardenclyffe Tower was just a sketch. V.S.I is the complete blueprint."

3. PLANETARY PROTECTION

· V.S.I shield: Protection against meteorites and cosmic radiation
· Climate control: Global temperature stabilization via iS field adjustment

4. FUTURE MEDICINE

· Resonance therapy: Adjust personal iS field to treat diseases
· Life extension: Optimize A-iS balance

5. PHILOSOPHY OF "PERFECTION IN IMPERFECTION"

V.S.I technology doesn't seek 100% perfection, but optimal harmony:

· 95% efficiency is enough - 5% remaining nourishes universal entropy
· 99.9% accuracy is enough - 0.1% error creates space for creativity
· Oscillation is not a bug, but a feature

---

PART IX: MISSION AND ETHICS - OPEN LEGACY FOR HUMANITY

"Knowledge is not for hoarding, but for spreading. Science is not for monopolizing, but for serving."

V.S.I theory, with its 21 equations and 6 foundational theorems, is published not as proprietary property, but as a gift of knowledge to humanity. We believe:

OPEN PHILOSOPHY - LEGACY FOR ALL

1. NOT PROPERTY, BUT LEGACY
   · V.S.I equations belong to humanity's common knowledge treasure
   · Like Newton's laws or relativity theory, they cannot be "owned"
   · Only specific applications can be protected, not basic principles
2. FREE BUT RESPONSIBLE LICENSE
   ```
   You are free to:
   - Research, develop, improve
   - Apply to technology for peaceful purposes
   - Share, teach, disseminate
   
   You may not:
   - Monopolize commercialization of basic principles
   - Use for destructive or harmful purposes
   - Hide or prevent others from accessing
   ```
3. CONSTANT ℒ = 20/11 - SIGNATURE, NOT BARRIER
   · Requiring ℒ = 20/11 is not for restriction
   · But to maintain consistency in the research community
   · Like π = 3.14159... or c = 299,792,458 m/s - it's a standard, not a barrier

CALL FOR SCIENTIFIC ETHICS

"Science knows no country, but the scientist does." - Louis Pasteur
"But scientific knowledge belongs to all humanity."

We call for:

1. ABSOLUTE TRANSPARENCY
   · All V.S.I-based research must be openly published
   · No hiding discoveries for narrow commercial interests
   · Errors too must be shared - for one person's failure is another's lesson
2. PRIORITIZING HUMAN SERVICE
   · First applications must target: poverty alleviation, disease treatment, environmental protection
   · Wireless energy technology must reach the most remote regions
   · Planetary shield must protect all, not just a few
3. PREVENTING MISUSE
   · Establish ethics committee to oversee V.S.I applications
   · Refuse cooperation with destructive military projects
   · Prioritize international cooperation over national competition

NEW DEVELOPMENT MODEL: "OPEN SOURCE SCIENCE"

V.S.I theory will develop under the Open Source Science model:

```python
class OpenScienceVSIModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.core_principles = "Public Domain"
        self.applications = "Patent with Commons Clause"
        self.research = "Always Open Access"
    
    def contribute(self, researcher, contribution):
        # All contributions are acknowledged
        # But no one "owns" the theory
        self.add_to_commons(contribution)
        self.credit(researcher)
        
    def commercialize(self, application):
        # Allow commercialization
        # But must share profits for common development fund
        royalty = application.profit * 0.01  # 1% for community
        self.commons_fund += royalty
```

100-YEAR VISION: WHEN V.S.I BECOMES COMMON KNOWLEDGE

We dream of a future where:

1. 2030: V.S.I taught in leading universities
2. 2050: V.S.I technology provides 30% of global energy
3. 2100: This theory becomes common knowledge, like Newtonian mechanics today

"Light is not diminished when shared. Neither is knowledge."

FINAL WORDS: A PERSPECTIVE FROM HISTORY

Einstein refused to work on the Manhattan Project when he saw its destructive potential. Tesla destroyed patents when he saw them being misused. Both understood:

THE TRUE POWER OF SCIENCE LIES NOT IN CONTROLLING KNOWLEDGE, BUT IN GIVING IT AWAY.

V.S.I is published in that spirit. We seek no personal glory, no monopoly profits. We only wish to see:

· An African student using this knowledge to create clean water sources
· A Vietnamese engineer using it to build energy systems for rural villages
· An Indian doctor using it to treat diseases without expensive medicines

"True knowledge is not knowing what you have, but knowing what you can give."

COMPLETELY OPEN RESOURCES:

V.S.I COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUND:

· 100% of commercial application profits will contribute 1% to this fund
· Fund sponsors research for young scientists, especially from developing countries
· Fund supports V.S.I applications for community projects

CONCLUSION: THE UNIVERSE'S SYMPHONY

"Imagination is more important than knowledge." - Einstein
"The present is theirs; the future is mine." - Tesla

V.S.I theory, with its 21 equations and 6 theorems, is not merely a scientific achievement, but a new vision of reality. It connects:

1. Einstein's unity: Matter (A) and information (iS) unified through $A + iS = 7\mathcal{L}$
2. Tesla's application: Opens breakthrough technologies in energy, communication, medicine
3. Philosophical harmony: Accepts oscillation and uncertainty as essential parts of the universe
4. Humanitarian openness: Published for common benefit, with sharing spirit

Final declaration from two great souls:

Einstein would probably say: "I don't know if V.S.I is correct, but it's mathematically beautiful, and nature loves beauty."

Tesla would probably say: "This is not mere theory. This is a blueprint for the future - a future where energy is free, information is instantaneous, and humanity protects its planet."

We do not seek the absolute, but harmony. We do not dominate nature, but resonate with it. V.S.I is that symphony - where equations and philosophy become one, where science and humanities meet, where past and future shake hands through the present.

"In this universe, absolute perfection does not exist - and that is the most perfect thing."
